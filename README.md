# Hypothesis Publisher Account Test Site

This is a web app to test how content publishers can use
[Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is)' Publisher Account feature to add annotation
functionality to their pages which is integrated with their existing account
system.

Note that this is only intended for us at Hypothesis to test the integration
functionality internally, it's not intended as a demo or example for
publishers.

Publishers who just want to add the Hypothesis client to their pages and allow users to annotate using Hypothesis accounts can simply [embed Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/for-publishers/).

## Installing the publisher account test site in a development environment

### You will need

* The publisher account test site integrates with h and the Hypothesis client,
  so you will need to set up development environments for each of those before
  you can develop the publisher account test site:

  * https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/install/
  * https://h.readthedocs.io/projects/client/en/latest/developers/developing/

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
  Follow the instructions in the pyenv README to install it.
  The Homebrew method works best on macOS.

### Clone the Git repo

    git clone https://github.com/hypothesis/publisher-account-test-site.git

This will download the code into a `publisher-account-test-site` directory in
your current working directory. You need to be in the
`publisher-account-test-site` directory from the remainder of the installation
process:

    cd publisher-account-test-site

### Create auth clients, groups and users in h

You need to create a couple of things in the Hypothesis service:

1. A set of credentials (a "client credentials" OAuth client) for managing users
   and groups associated with your domain.

2. A set of credentials (a "JWT bearer" OAuth client) for creating signed tokens that
   the Hypothesis client can use to automatically log in as a particular user.

3. A group associated with your domain to which users can post annotations.
   Annotations from this group will be displayed when the Hypothesis client
   loads on your pages.

In [Hypothesis development environments](http://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing/install/), you can do this using the `hypothesis` CLI tool:

1. Go to http://localhost:5000/admin/oauthclients and create a new OAuth client
   with the type set to "client_credentials" and the authority set to "partner.org".

   This will give you a client ID and secret which can be used to create
   accounts on the Hypothesis service via the API.

2. Create another OAuth client on the same page with the type set to
   "jwt_bearer" and the authority also set to "partner.org"

   This will give you an additional client ID and secret pair which can be used to generate
   _grant tokens_ which can be used to identify the logged-in user to the
   Hypothesis client.

3. Create an admin user for partner.org:
   ```sh
   ./bin/hypothesis --dev user add --authority partner.org --username admin --email admin@localhost --password secret
   ```

4. Create the main group for annotations on partner.org
   ```sh
   ./bin/hypothesis --dev groups add-open-group --authority partner.org --name Partner --creator admin --origin http://localhost:5050
   ```

### Set environment variables

The publisher account test site requires several environment variables to be
set. Set the following environment variables in your shell:

    export HYPOTHESIS_SERVICE="http://localhost:5000" # Point to the local H service
    export HYPOTHESIS_AUTHORITY=partner.org  # Domain name used when registering publisher account
    export HYPOTHESIS_CLIENT_ID=$CLIENT_ID
    export HYPOTHESIS_CLIENT_SECRET=$CLIENT_SECRET
    export HYPOTHESIS_JWT_CLIENT_ID=$JWT_CLIENT_ID
    export HYPOTHESIS_JWT_CLIENT_SECRET=$JWT_CLIENT_SECRET


### Start the development server

    make dev

The first time you run `make dev` it might take a while to start because it'll
need to install the application dependencies and build the client assets.

This will start the server on port 5050 (http://localhost:5050), reload the
application whenever changes are made to the source code, and restart it should
it crash for some reason.

**That's it!** Youâ€™ve finished setting up your publisher account test site
development environment. Run `make help` to see all the commands that're
available for linting etc.

### Using the app

Once the development server is running:

1. Go to [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050) to view the test page.
2. Enter a username and click "Sign up" to create an account on the publisher site.

The first time you log in with a particular username, a corresponding account
will be created on the Hypothesis service.

After logging in, you can annotate content in the article by selecting text and
clicking the "Annotate" or "Highlight" buttons that appear.

## How it works

When you "Sign up" on the test site, a request is made to the [Create user API](http://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#operation/createUser) to create an account with the given username within the namespace of your publisher account. When the page loads, it creates a [JWT token](https://jwt.io/) for the logged-in user, using the client ID and secret, and embeds it in the generated page.

When the Hypothesis client runs, it calls the `window.hypothesisConfig()` function to fetch the configuration for the annotation client and reads the grant token. It then exchanges this grant token for an access token which allows the client to create annotations using this username.
