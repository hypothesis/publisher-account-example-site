      <p><i>As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr.
      Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand
      leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare.
      In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists
      when the fighting has ceased.  He urges that men of science should
      then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our
      bewildering store of knowledge.  For many years inventions have
      extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind.
      Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the
      eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but the
      end results, of modern science.  Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are
      at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and
      command over the inherited knowledge of the ages.  The perfection of
      these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our
      scientists as they emerge from their war work.  Like Emerson's famous
      address of 1837 on ``The American Scholar,'' this paper by Dr. Bush
      calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our
      knowledge. - The Editor</i></p>

      This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all
      have had a part.  The scientists, burying their old professional
      competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and
      learned much.  It has been exhilarating to work in effective
      partnership.  Now, for many, this appears to be approaching an end.
      What are the scientists to do next?
      </p>

      <p>
      For the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there
      can be little indecision, for their war work has hardly required them
      to leave the old paths.  Many indeed have been able to carry on their
      war research in their familiar peacetime laboratories.  Their
      objectives remain much the same.

      It is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride,
      who have left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive
      gadgets, who have had to devise new methods for their unanticipated
      assignments.  They have done their part on the devices that made it
      possible to turn back the enemy.  They have worked in combined effort
      with the physicists of our allies.  They have felt within themselves
      the stir of achievement.  They have been part of a great team.  Now,
      as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy
      of their best.
